# Flutter Blog App

A blog application built with flutter for android/ios mobile devices which provides a simple and user-friendly way to read on various topics. Users can read other's blogs, can upload their own blogs and also user is allowed to store blogs in their favourites so that they can be accessed when their is no internet connection.

This application makes use of clean architecture and it's state management is implemented with flutter bloc and provider. The main goal of this application is to learn the aspects of clean architecture which uses 3 layers of data, domain and presentation. 

Clean Architecture is a software design approach that emphasizes separating concerns within a system into distinct layers, each with clear boundaries and dependencies. It aims to create systems that are easy to understand, maintain, and extend by promoting modularity, testability, and flexibility. The core principles include separating business logic from implementation details, dependency inversion, and the dependency rule, which states that dependencies should flow towards more abstract, stable components.
